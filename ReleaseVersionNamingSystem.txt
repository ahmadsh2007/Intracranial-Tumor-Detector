Software Release Version Types

1. Major Version (X.0.0)
Indicates: Significant changes to the software, such as breaking changes or major updates.
Example: 2.0.0 - A new major version is released with potential backward-incompatible changes.

2. Minor Version (1.X.0)
Indicates: New features or functionality added to the software in a backward-compatible manner.
Example: 1.3.0 - A new minor version adds features but does not break existing functionality.

3. Patch Version (1.0.X)
Indicates: Bug fixes or minor improvements that are backward-compatible.
Example: 1.0.3 - A patch that fixes issues without changing the software's functionality.

4. Pre-release Versions (X.X.X-alpha, X.X.X-beta, etc.)
Indicates: Versions that are not stable and may not be fully functional or feature-complete.
Examples:
1.0.0-alpha - An alpha version, typically for internal testing or very early development.
1.0.0-beta - A beta version, usually a public release for testing new features, with the expectation
that there may be bugs.

5. Release Candidate (X.X.X-rc)
Indicates: A version that is potentially the final release unless significant bugs are found.
Example: 1.0.0-rc1 - Release candidate 1, ready for public testing before the final stable release.

6. Final Release (X.X.X)
Indicates: The stable and fully-functional version of the software.
Example: 1.0.0 - The official stable release of the software.

7. Patch/Hotfix Versions
Indicates: A very small release typically focused on immediate critical fixes.
Example: 1.0.1 or 1.0.0-hf1 - Hotfix for urgent issues or security patches.

8. Long-Term Support (LTS) Versions
Indicates: A version that will be supported for an extended period, often with important security
patches and bug fixes.
Example: 1.0.0 LTS - A version designated for extended support.

9. Development Version (X.X.X-dev)
Indicates: A version that is in active development and may not be stable or feature-complete.
Example: 1.0.0-dev - A development version of the software for early or internal use.
