## **Introduction**

Medical errors (MEs) represent one of the most critical challenges within the healthcare sector, and they can be categorized into several types. This project focuses on **diagnostic errors**. **Misdiagnosis** is one of the most common types of malpractice, with **cancer** being one of the most likely conditions to be misdiagnosed. Given the malignant and unpredictable nature of cancer, diagnostic errors could result in **irreversible life-threatening complications** or even mortality.

## **Project Overview**

The **Intracranial Tumor Detector (ICTD)** implements the revolutionary technology of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** within **Deep Learning (DL)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** in image classification to ensure no tumors go undetected. 

## **Dataset and Preprocessing**

First, we built an **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) dataset**, compromising a public dataset from **Kaggle** and images from a **local hospital**. We preprocessed the images by:

- Resizing
- Normalizing
- Augmenting them

## **Model Development**

After preprocessing, we ran the images through a **Neural Network** that extracts and learns features from them, then classifies them into two groups: 

- **Brain tumor**
- **No tumor**

## **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

We then created a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** for **medical professionals** to interact with the model.

## **Results and Conclusion**

Finally, we analyzed the results and calculated **accuracy improvement** over time. An accuracy of **over 65%** was achieved. We concluded that higher accuracy could have been achieved if:

- Better processing power had been available
- Better algorithms and tools had been used

Nevertheless, this concept is **applicable and crucial for saving lives**.
